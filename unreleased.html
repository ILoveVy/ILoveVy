						<p class="major">Once upon a time in a faraway place, there lived a bear, grown fat on the land. He roamed free and careless, in search of his mate, but in his land, there was no one like him. Though he did speak with the birds and laugh with the fish, they were not of his kind, and so they did not understand him.<br><br>And so he roamed, free and careless, in search of one who would.</p>

						<p class="major">In the spring, he ate berries from bushes, caught salmon in the stream. He slept warm in his winter coat on soft grasses under the boughs of willow trees. The days grew warmer, the place alive and teeming. And although he was happy, he was not content.<br><br>And so he roamed.</p>

						<p class="major">In summer, he hunted fiercely, chasing boars and wolves alike, and ate like a king. In the heat, he would immerse himself in streams, catching complacent bass and drinking cool mountain water. The fields he wandered through were wreathed in flowers and sunlight, a tapestry of gold and red fit for his majesty. His appetite had grown such that even these things could not satiate him. He knew that he wanted something that was not of this land.<br><br>And so he roamed.</p>

His summer fat had sustained him, but now even those streams that were overrun with fish had run low and dry. But he could not turn back. Within him, his desire burned even stronger. To find his mate, so that he could see into her eyes and know he was whole.<br><br>And so he roamed.</p>

						<p class="major">The winter was most cruel. Though he had wanted to sleep deep below the icy surface, his legs moved, provoked by his beating heart. Each day, he pulled himself forward, waking long before the sun and sleeping long after it had resigned itself to bed. Scarce were his meals, and desperate was his hunger. He ate the frozen grasses under the ice, the rotting nuts that were stored by long-lost jesters, and not once did he find even a tiny field mouse. Although the wind was cruel and the land was bleak, the bear was stronger than even he had known. He pressed forward into the night.<br><br>And so he roamed, once more.</p>

						<p class="major">It happened almost silently. The days seemed to be less sadistic, more bearable. The grasses and nuts he foraged were sweeter. He happened upon an old oak tree one morning and saw that there was life amongst its branches. And he heard the call of birdsong once more. Day by day, the ice thawed, and the nights felt shorter. Life filled the bear, and he began to feel again. To dream again. Daring to hope that he might find his mate. He felt the electric energy of spring upon him.<br><br>And so he roamed.</p>

						<p class="major">In her eyes, there was warmth. Our bear had stopped still, halfway immersed in the lake. Ripples of water radiated outward, betraying him. In her eyes, there was caution. He stayed still, afraid that if he moved again, he might scare her, that she might run, and that he might never find her. They breathed softly in the crisp morning air, like accidental dragons. In her eyes, there was... curiosity? She had been on the far bank of the lake, head bowed and drinking as though in Morning Prayer. Now she looked straight at him, but he dared not move.<br><br>And just as quickly as she'd appeared, she turned and disappeared into the forest. </p>

						<p class="major">He stumbled forward into the clearing and was sure that he had erred, for the scene had changed, fast like a shock of cold water. In the centre of a clearing, ringed by trees, lay the torn body of a bison. A mighty beast of the land, its blood running cold into the thrashed-up mud, and upon him was the enemy. Eight wolves stared at him, bloody maws, flesh hanging from their teeth, their eyes pitch black, and he heard their anger. He had interrupted them, and so, as any polite unwanted guest, he went to make his exit. But as he turned, he saw that he was surrounded.<br><br>And so he was backed into the centre of the clearing.</p>

						<p class="major">His blood was so full of fear that it felt like time had slowed. He heard the sound behind him and felt the sharp red bite on the back of his arm. He roared and spun, throwing the beast, and they were upon him. They attacked him in unison, ripping and tearing at his flanks, while their brothers kept his attention, biting his nose and clawing at his face. Pain exploded from the bear, and he mauled furiously, hitting back. The crunch of bones under his mighty paws was followed by a whimpering scream. An attack from behind him tore into the flesh of his thigh, and as he screamed, he pulled the wolf upward and tore into its throat, rending its head from its body. Blood flowed underneath, his, the wolves', and the cold blood of the bison, soaking the torn-up grass. The wolves sounded a surrender and ran into the forest.<br><br>And suddenly, it was quiet again.</p>

He limped toward the edge of the clearing, a trail of crimson behind him, and collapsed at the base of a tree. He felt his shallow breathing slow, the taste of iron in his mouth, and his vision blurred and turned to dark.<br><br>He was not alone.</p>
